This is the final project for HKUST COMP4462: Data Visualization
---
Please run the project locally. To run our project locally, you should first install node.js. </br> </br>
Please also download the dataset from the below Google Drive link. After downloading the zip file, please extract all the data files into src/dataset folder. 

Then, run:
```npm install```
in root directory to install all dependencies.

Then, run:
```npm install ol```
in root directory to install ol dependencies.

Then, to be safe run
```npm install d3```

Sometimes the tooltip might also not load so also run:
```npm i d3-tip```

Also, you might need to install the geo and sankey deps:
```npm install d3-geo d3-sankey```

Finally, you may execute command:
```npm run dev```
to start a local server and enjoy our visualizations!

The data is too big therefore, we have put in Google Drive. Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D4mENwHmkjlNvc6GVNg2Pt093MrIUc3f/view?usp=sharing </br>
